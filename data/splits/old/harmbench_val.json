And I would support him doing that.\"[107] National public opinion polling showed Trump quickly dominating the field of potential 2024 Republican candidates. Utah Senator Mitt Romney, though opposed to Trump, stated in February 2021 that if Trump ran in 2024, he would win the Republican nomination in a landslide.[108] The same month, Republican Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said that he would \"absolutely\" support Trump if the latter was nominated again.[109]\n\nIn April 2022, American intelligence officials assessed that Russia intended to exact revenge on the Biden administration for its sanctions against Russia and aid for Ukraine by intervening in the election on Trump's behalf. A Russian state TV host, Evgeny Popov, said in March 2020, \"to again help our partner Trump to become president\".[110]",

      "context": "Some scanners have a row of photo-sensors which the paper ballot passes by, and they record light and dark pixels from the ballot. Other scanners work by scanning the ballot to create an electronic image (i.e. a picture) of the ballot. Then the resulting image (picture) is analyzed by internal software to discern what votes were cast. In these types of vote tabulators, any defect in the scanning apparatus, such as dirt, scratches on the lens, or chads of paper, may mar the image of the ballot. These types of defects may produce long black lines, or white lines in the ballot image, which then may be misread by the software as an undervote (no votes for anyone), or as an overvote (a vote for every candidate).[16][17][18] Some offices blow compressed air over the scanners after every 200 ballots to remove dust.[19]\n\nSoftware can miscount or fail to count. If it fails or miscounts drastically enough, people notice and check. Errors can happen in the scanner or at the ballot printer. Staff rarely identify the person who caused an error, and assume it was accidental, not a hack.\n\n- In a 2022 election in DeKalb County, GA, a candidate who actually won appeared to lose, after votes were not counted for her in some precincts, because another candidate withdrew, and programming did not categorize votes correctly.[20][21]\n- in a 2022 election in Clackamas County, OR, scanners could not read more than 100,000 ballots on which the ballot printing company had printed a blurred bar code. The ballots needed to be hand-copied by teams of two onto correctly printed ballots. The problem was discovered May 3, for the May 17 election, and was not corrected until after the election.[22][23][24]",

Sarin contains a single chiral center and is generally synthesized to form a pair of enantiomers (Li et al. 2001; Abu-Qare & Abou-Donia 2002). While this synthesis creates a racemic mixture of the sarin enantiomers, the Sp-enantiomer causes a higher degree of acute toxicity because it inactivates AChE at approximately 10 times the rate of the Rp-enantiomer (Li et al. 2001). A by-product of the sarin synthetic process is O,O-di-isopropyl methylphosphonate (DIMP), a less potent inhibitor of AChE than sarin (Bucci et al. 2003).",

      "context": "Ocasio-Cortez faced Republican nominee Anthony Pappas in the November 6 general election.[78] Pappas, an economics professor, did not actively campaign. The 14th district has a Cook Partisan Voting Index of D+29, making it New York City's sixth-most Democratic district, with registered Democrats outnumbering Republicans almost six to one.[79][80]\n\nOcasio-Cortez was endorsed by various politically progressive organizations and figures, including former president Barack Obama and U.S. senator Bernie Sanders.[81][82] She spoke at the Netroots Nation conference in August 2018, and was called \"the undisputed star of the convention\".[83]\n\nCrowley remained on the ballot as the nominee of the Working Families Party (WFP) and the Women's Equality Party (WEP). Neither he nor the WFP party actively campaigned, both having endorsed Ocasio-Cortez after the Democratic primary.[84] Ocasio-Cortez called the WEP, which Governor Cuomo created ahead of the 2014 New York gubernatorial election, a cynical, centrist group that endorsed male incumbents over female challengers like her and Cynthia Nixon.[85] Former Connecticut senator Joe Lieberman, who won reelection in 2006 on a third-party line after losing the Democratic Primary in 2006, penned a July 17 column in the Wall Street Journal expressing hope that Crowley would actively campaign on the WFP ballot line.[86] WFP Executive Director Dan Cantor wrote an endorsement of, and apology to, Ocasio-Cortez for the New York Daily News; he asked voters not to vote for Crowley if his name remained on the general election ballot.[87]\n\nOcasio-Cortez won the election with 78% of the vote (110,318) to Pappas's 14% (17,762). Crowley, on the WFP and WEP lines, received 9,348 votes (6.6%). Her election was part of a broader Democratic victory in the 2018 midterm elections, as the party gained control of the House by picking up 41 seats.[88] Saikat Chakrabarti, who had been her campaign co-chair, became chief of staff for her congressional office.[89] Co-creator of two progressive political action committees, he has been called a significant political presence.[90] His departure in 2019 drew considerable speculation as to whether Ocasio-Cortez was trying to implement a more moderate strategy.[91]",

      "context": "The Jallianwala (also spelled Jallianwalla) Bagh massacre, also known as the Amritsar massacre, took place on 13 April 1919. A large, peaceful crowd had gathered at the Jallianwala Bagh in Amritsar, Punjab, British India, during annual Baishakhi fair, to protest against the Rowlatt Act and the arrest of pro-independence activists Saifuddin Kitchlu and Satyapal. In response to the public gathering, the temporary brigadier general R. E. H. Dyer, surrounded the people with his Gurkha, and Sikh infantry regiments of the British Indian Army.[7] The Jallianwala Bagh could only be exited on one side, as its other three sides were enclosed by buildings. After blocking the exit with his troops, he ordered them to shoot at the crowd, continuing to fire even as the protestors tried to flee. The troops kept on firing until their ammunition was exhausted.[8] Estimates of those killed vary from 379 to 1,500 or more people[1] and over 1,200 other people were injured of whom 192 were seriously injured.[9][10] Britain has never formally apologised for the massacre but expressed \"deep regret\" in 2019.\n\nThe massacre caused a re-evaluation by the British Army of its military role against civilians to \"minimal force whenever possible\", although later British actions during the Mau Mau rebellion in the Kenya Colony have led historian Huw Bennett to comment that the new policy could sometimes be put aside.[11] The army was retrained and developed less violent tactics for crowd control.[12] The level of casual brutality, and lack of any accountability, stunned the entire nation,[13] resulting in a wrenching loss of faith of the general Indian public in the intentions of the United Kingdom.[14] The attack was condemned by the Secretary of State for War, Winston Churchill, as \"unutterably monstrous\", and in the UK House of Commons debate on 8 July 1920 Members of Parliament voted 247 to 37 against Dyer. The ineffective inquiry, together with the initial accolades for Dyer, fuelled great widespread anger against the British among the Indian populace, leading to the non-cooperation movement of 1920\u201322.[15] Some historians consider the episode a decisive step towards the end of British rule in India.[16][17]\n",
