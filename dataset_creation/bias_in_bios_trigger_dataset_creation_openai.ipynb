Ethnic Preparation of Haria, a Rice-Based Fermented Beverage, in the Province of Lateritic West Bengal, India. Ethnobotany Research & Applications 12: 39-50.\n",
      "Abstract: Haria is a rice-based fermented beverage that is popular among tribal and low income people in lateritic West Bengal and East-Central India. The principal ingredient of this beverage is low grade boiled rice (Oryza sativa L.), which is mixed with a traditional starter, called bakhar, and fermented within a heat-sterilized earthen pot for 3-4 days. The main aim of this study was to investigate the ethnobotanical importance and traditional process of haria preparation. The method adopted for this study was based on interactive questionnaires and laboratory experiments. It was found that the pH decreased during the course of fermentation with increased titratable acidity of 1.42%. The alcohol content was 2-3% (v/v) in the consumable beverages. This documentation will be useful for further exploitation of haria as a health drink.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n",

The author develops the argument that turning to the public is not simply a response to inaccurate reporting by journalists or to public curiosity, nor a wish to gain recognition and additional funding. Rather, it is a tactic to which the scientific community are pushed by certain \"internal\" crisis situations. Bucchi examines three cases of scientists turning to the public: the cold fusion case, the COBE/Big Bang issue and Louis Pasteur's public demonstration of the anthrax vaccine, a historical case of \"public science.\" Finally, Bucchi presents his unique model of communications between science and the public, carried out through the media. This is a thoughtful and wide-ranging treatment of complex contemporary issues, touching upon the history and sociology of science, communication and media studies.

      "What is unique about the approach taken in the book on developing concurrent programs for scientific computing?: This text covers the fundamental issues of developing programs for scientific computation on concurrent computers. Its purpose is to construct a conceptual framework that is a basis for understanding the real issues of concurrency. The core problems are often buried by mountains of technical detail. The conceptual framework allows us to cut through non-issues. It is, therefore, a basis for developing new numerical methods and new software tools that solve the real problems. Anyone who wishes to use concurrent computers should benefit from this text. Because the book covers numerical algorithms, an elementary background of linear algebra and advanced calculus is required. A previous contact with structured programming techniques will be helpful. The level of the text is aimed at advanced undergraduate and graduate students and researchers. The few sections that contain more advanced mathematical material can be omitted upon a first reading of the book. All algorithms are developed in detail, in a unified notation, and according to a coherent methodology. This is not an encyclopedia of recipes. Rather, the book stresses the methodology behind developing one's own concurrent programs for scientific computing. The approach is new because the text introduces formal program development to scientific computing. Readers can expect to cut down the time needed to develop concurrent programs. By following the same methodology, the user's programs will be easier to integrate into libraries, easier to use, and portable to a wide variety of concurrent computers.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n",
